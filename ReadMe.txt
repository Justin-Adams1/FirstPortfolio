Thank you for checking out my first Portfolio! This is the first version of a Portfolio website that I created at the start of my software development career. I keep this around as a reminder of where I started.

Please feel free to check out all the rest of my projects, and read through some of them. I'm proud of all the work I've put in, from the start to the present.
